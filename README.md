# Design-of-Single-Stage-OTA-using-28nm-CMOS-Technology
# Abstract
In this repository, CMOS-based single-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is presented with a unity gain bandwidth (UGB) of 30MHz. The CMOS based OTA (CMOSOTA) is designed by sizing (W/L) of the MOSFETs using gm/Id methodology. The mathematical expressions for performance specifications are applied over the graphical models to evaluate the required W/L. Finally, the performance parameters such as DC gain UGB are verified through simulation. This design is implemented using Synopsys Custom Compiler on as a part of Cloud Based Analog IC Design Hackathon.
